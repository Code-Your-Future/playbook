## Suggestion on the time structure
From previous sessions we found a good mix of different activities in the class that work well.

1. Code review - discuss homework, students can present their solution and talk about difficult, or interesting parts (duration ~30mins)
- Introduce new concepts (30min)
- Break (5 min)
- Students work in pair and practice the theory they learnt (1.5 hours)
- Lunch (30 min)
- Group discussion (what is clear what not) - assignment explanation - ~30mins

## Operations Tips
- Let students download material required for the class in advance.
