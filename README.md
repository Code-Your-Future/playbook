## Suggestion on the time structure
From previous sessions we found a good mix of different activities in the class that work well.

- **Code review** (~30mins) - Discuss homework from previous lesson. Students should be encouraged to present their solution and talk about their difficulties, or interesting solutions
- **Introduce new concepts** (~30min) Use visual or live demo if possible and check if students understand the concept
- **Break** (5 min)
- **Pair-Programming** (~ 1.5 hours) - Students work in pair and practice the theory they learnt
- **Lunch** (30 min)
- **Retrospective** (~10 mins) - Group discussion (what is clear what not) 
- **Assignment explanation** (~15mins)

## Tips
- Give students material about the topic in the next session to read in advance
- Let students download material required for the class in advance.
